* Fix Emacs' selection after window quit/close

Repro: C-x 3 C-x o C-x o C-x 2 C-x 0

Result: Switches focus to the other split side instead of the parent
window.

Very likely to be something with ~delete-window-internal~.

* Rewrite a sane subset of helm

Let's call it union (since there's unite and it's one char shorter,
also there's this very pretty kind of segment LEDs of which I happen
to have an appropriate animated GIF).

* Rewrite a sane subset of dired

Let's call it RIND (for RIND Is Not Dired or Ranger-INspired Dired).
