This is my literate Emacs configuration.  Most of the code is located
in init.org_ and kickstarted by init.el_, the rest is `unpublished
stuff`_, a `required config file`_, a `heavily customized fork`_ of
`bbatsov's solarized theme`_, a `list of notes what to hack on`_
and `outdated notes`_ for `installation of dependencies`_.

Regarding licensing, I'm opting out of copyright alltogether with the
Unlicense_ with the exception of the unpublished code which is still
covered by copyright.
